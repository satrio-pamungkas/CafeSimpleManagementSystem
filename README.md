# Cafe Simple Management System
This project is an example of OAuth strategy implementation in .NET. So we cannot request any resources from Items endpoint without authenticated.

I'm also consider to decouple authorization server from resource server especially in microservices architecture in the further project

## Features
- [x] Create account 
- [x] Login to account
- [x] Get access token response with 5 minutes expire
- [x] Protect Items resources endpoint with authorization token validation check
- [] Add refresh token functionality
- [] Add email verification functionality
- [] Add other resources to protect
